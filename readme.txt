Built with PHP Event Calendar Lite, PHP Event Calendar lets you easily create, share, and display beautiful, responsive event calendar online.  

== Description ==

The plugin is built with FREE PHP Event Calendar Lite edition. It is a modern, responsive, multi-user calendar/scheduling application. It can be used right out of the box as a standalone event calendar application or can be customized easily to seamlessly integrate into your own environment.

PHP Event Calendar supports multiple calendars, shared and public calendars, repeating/recurring events, event drag and drop, Google Calendar import, email reminder, and many other features.

PHP Event Calendar supports all major Web browsers as well as iOS and Android devices.

The Lite edition is similar to full version with a few limitations. The Lite edition allows single calendar only; no recurring/repeating events; no email reminder. The full version has no those limitations.
