Built with PHP Event Calendar Lite, PHP Event Calendar lets you easily create, share, and display beautiful, responsive event calendar online.  

== Description ==

The plugin is built with FREE [PHP Event Calendar](http://phpeventcalendar.com/ "PHP Event Calendar") Lite version. It is a modern, responsive, multi-user calendar/scheduling application. It can be used right out of the box as a standalone event calendar application or can be customized easily to seamlessly integrate into your own environment. It supports all major Web browsers as well as iOS and Android devices.

The Lite version is similar to full version with a few limitations: allows single calendar only; no recurring/repeating events; no email reminder. The full version has no those limitations. 

PHP Event Calendar full version supports:

* Multiple calendars, 
* Shared and public calendars, 
* Repeating/recurring events, 
* Event drag and drop, 
* Email reminders, 
* Agenda and custom list view,
* Event search
* More to come!
